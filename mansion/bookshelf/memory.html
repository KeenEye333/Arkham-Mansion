<p class="parchment">In the valley of Nis the accursed waning moon shines thinly, tearing a path for its light with 
feeble horns through the lethal foliage of a great upas-tree. And within the depths of the 
valley, where the light reaches not, move forms not meet to be beheld. Rank is the herbage 
on each slope, where evil vines and creeping plants crawl amidst the stones of ruined 
palaces, twining tightly about broken columns and strange monoliths, and heaving up marble 
pavements laid by forgotten hands. And in trees that grow gigantic in crumbling courtyards 
leap little apes, while in and out of deep treasure-vaults writhe poison serpents and scaly 
things without a name.</p>
<p class="parchment">Vast are the stones which sleep beneath coverlets of dank moss, and mighty were the walls 
from which they fell. For all time did their builders erect them, and in sooth they yet serve 
nobly, for beneath them the grey toad makes his habitation.</p>
<p class="parchment">At the very bottom of the valley lies the river Than, whose waters are slimy and filled with 
weeds. From hidden springs it rises, and to subterranean grottoes it flows, so that the 
Daemon of the Valley knows not why its waters are red, nor whither they are bound.</p>
<p class="parchment">The Genie that haunts the moonbeams spake to the Daemon of the Valley, saying, "I am old, 
and forget much. Tell me the deeds and aspect and name of them who built these things of 
stone." And the Daemon replied, "I am Memory, and am wise in lore of the past, but I too am 
old. These beings were like the waters of the river Than, not to be understood. Their deeds I 
recall not, for they were but of the moment. Their aspect I recall dimly, for it was like to that of 
the little apes in the trees. Their name I recall clearly, for it rhymed with that of the river. These 
beings of yesterday were called Man." </p>
<p class="parchment">So the Genie flew back to the thin horned moon, and the Daemon looked intently at a little 
ape in a tree that grew in a crumbling courtyard.</p>
